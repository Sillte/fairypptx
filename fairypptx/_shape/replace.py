    Policy - What  `replace` means? -
    ---------------------------------
    It is important to `dst` can behave like `src`, after this function.
    (Since normally you ask your friend to replace some machines, 
     then you expect them to work as before? )
P
    Maybe what should be transferred depends on type of `dst`.
